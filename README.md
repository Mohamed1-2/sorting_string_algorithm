# sorting string algorithm Using Java  ðŸ‘€
In this project, I have used three of the most popular sorting string algorithms(quicksort, mergesort and 3-way quicksort) to sort a group of words from a text file in a given url.
A comparison was also made between the speed of execution of algorithms in sorting a group of words in terms of the first letter in each executed word .
